    TODO: Before you run your application, you need a Google Maps API key.

    To get one, follow this link, follow the directions and press "Create" at the end:

https://console.developers.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=maps_android_backend&keyType=CLIENT_SIDE_ANDROID&r=04:32:59:D7:BD:B0:91:57:C8:A7:BA:8C:69:F3:E2:BB:A9:BA:01:E5%3Bca.mudar.parkcatcher

    You can also add your credentials to an existing key, using this line:
    04:32:59:D7:BD:B0:91:57:C8:A7:BA:8C:69:F3:E2:BB:A9:BA:01:E5;ca.mudar.parkcatcher

    Once you have your key (it starts with "AIza"), replace the "google_maps_key"
    string in this file.
